# Pomodoro-Timer

This application was built to help the user focus by using
a technique invented by famous Italian Scholar Francesco Cirillo.
It sets a break and focus duration to allow time for targeted
action on particular tasks.

The application allows the user to set a focus and a break duration
for the individual task at hand. Once the user hits play, the
timer will begin running until it hits the end of the durations
length. A progress bar at the bottom of the screen will display
how much time is left.

Technologies Used: React, Bootstrap, and JSX.
